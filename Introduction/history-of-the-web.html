    <p>
      Once upon a time, the web didn't exist. At least not the way we know it
      now. However some really smart guy at some research lab thought of way for
      researchers, scientists, engineers and professors to share information
      with each other accross geographical by linking to and from diffrent
      sources of information stored on difrent computers accross the globe.
    </p>

    <p>
      The name of that smart guy is Lee Berners, a british computer scientist.
      He invented the World Wide Web in 1989. By October 1990 Tim had written
      the fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today. The
      technologies are;
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>HTML - HyperText Markup Language</li>
      <li>HTTP - HyperText Transmission Protocol</li>
      <li>URI - Uniform Resource Identifier</li>
      <li>HTTPD - HyperText Transmission Protocol Daemon.</li>
      <li>
        Browser - World Wide Web Application for rendering and viewing HTML He
        launched the first webpage in 1990.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Today HTML is the foundational stucture of the web.  
    </p>
    <h3>How does HTML fit in
      with the two web other technologies?</h3>
      <p><b>HTML</b> provides the structure of the
      webpage</p>
    <p>
      <b>CSS</b> - Cascading Style Sheets, provides the presenation of the webpage, how
      it looks and feels
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Javascript</b> - is a programing language that provides the functionality,
      interactivity and behaviour of a webpage.
    </p>

    <p>
      This course teaches the fundamentals of web developemnt and explores how
      these technologies can be used in combination to build simple and advanced
      Applications, User Interfaces, and Components that run in the Browser, on
      any device that has access to the internet.
    </p>

      >Note: The world web web isn't the Internet, it rides on the internet,
      that is, it uses the internet as its underlying technology to access,
      transport and connect to diffrent computers globally that send and recieve
      web resources.</em
